EXERCISE : 1 INTRODUCTION
Ex No: E1a DATE: 04-03-2022
1.Welcome to the world of Java! In this challenge, we practice printing to stdout.
The code stubs in your editor declare a Solution class and a main method. Complete the
main method by copying the two lines of code below and pasting them inside the body of
your main method.
System.out.println("Hello, World.");
System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
Input Format
There is no input for this challenge.
Output Format
You must print two lines of output:
1. Print Hello, World. on the first line.
2. Print Hello, Java. on the second line.
Sample Output
Hello, World.
Hello, Java
Program Code:
public class Solution {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("Hello, World.");
System.out.println("Hello, Java.");
}
}
Output:
Your Output(Stdout)
Hello, World.
Hello, Java.

2. Most HackerRank challenges require you to read input from stdin (standard input) and write
output to stdout (standard output).
One popular way to read input from stdin is by using the Scanner class and specifying the Input
Stream as System.in. For example:
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String myString = scanner.next();
int myInt = scanner.nextInt();
scanner.close();


System.out.println("myString is: " + myString);
System.out.println("myInt is: " + myInt);
The code above creates a Scanner object named and uses it to read a String and an int. It then
closes the Scanner object because there is no more input to read, and prints to stdout using
System.out.println(String). So, if our input is:
Hi 5
Our code will print:
myString is: Hi
myInt is: 5
Alternatively, you can use the BufferedReader class.
Task
In this challenge, you must read integers from stdin and then print them to stdout. Each integer
must be printed on a new line. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is
provided for you in the editor below.
Input Format
There are lines of input, and each line contains a single integer.
Sample Input
Sample Output
Program Code:
42
100
125
myString is: Hi
myInt is: 5

System.out.println(b);
System.out.println(c);
// Complete this line
